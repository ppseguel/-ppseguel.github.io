I'm interested in collaborative technologies mainly applied to Digital Economy and innovation, social media, as well as Open Government related issues. I’m a Master Student In Information Sciences at UT Austin and soon will start his Ph.D. in Management at McGill University on the specialization of Information Systems. I work in scientific research, organizational consultancy, analytics and facilitation using service design techniques. Nowadays, I’m currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant in projects related to ICT4D in South America and sustainability for scientific software.
