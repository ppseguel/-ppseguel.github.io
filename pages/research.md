#### <u>Data workflow: Academy awards demographics and popularity</u>
*This project explores the relationship between data from academy awards winners for best actor/actress and movies. More specifically our goals are to:
1. Analyze the relationship between social media popularity of oscar winning actors/actresses (Facebook likes for actors/actresses) and their social demographics (race/ethnicity, sexual orientation and religion).
2. Analyze the relationship between award winning movies in terms of IMDB recommendation (number of user reviews and IMDB rating scores) and social media popularity (facebook likes for the movie).
3. Analyze relations between actors’ characteristics (race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion and social media popularity) and movie’s popularity scores(metacritic ratings,imdb score)*

*Tools used: SQL, Python, Tableau*
*Skills: Data wrangling, relational databases, visualization*
